    testimonials: "Adrian is a very talented software developer. He is far more experienced than his CV would suggest. He has mainly worked with C# and PowerShell/Nuget/TeamCity/Octopus, but he is also very good with F# and SQL. He can implement even complex functionalities on his own and is willing to understand the business domain he is working on."
